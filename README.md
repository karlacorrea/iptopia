##  IPTOPIA

This game was developed by Karla Corrêa (Developer), Andressa Alves (2D Artist) and Sabrina Gonçalves (Narrative) in the IP Challenge, which took place from April 28 to 30, 2023.
IPTopia is a simulator of a trademark and patent registration office, where the player starts as a newly hired employee. The goal is to level up to be promoted as you complete missions and challenges that address different aspects of intellectual property.
During the game, the player receives help and guidance about intellectual property from Dr Amora who is his supervisor.
